# PreferenceRank
Sorting made better, powered by science.

## Introduction
Inspired by viral character/bias sorters, but reimagined with a more rigorous approach. This tool brings scientific precision to preference ranking while keeping it fun and easy to use.

## Quick Start
1. Download the HTML file.
2. Open it in any modern browser.
3. Start ranking!

That's it! No installation needed. Feel free to customize the source code to your needs.

## Key Features
- **Flexible Input**: Rank anything you want - characters, foods, movies, travel destinations, you name it;
- **Fair Algorithm**: Uses round-robin tournament system ensuring every item gets evaluated against all others;
- **Scientific Scoring**: Implements Bradley-Terry Elo rating system for transparent and relative preference scores;
- **Lightweight**: Single HTML file, no external dependencies.

## Future Improvements (help wanted)
- Implement robust "undo" functionality during ranking battles.

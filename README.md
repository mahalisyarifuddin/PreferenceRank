# PreferenceRank
Sorting made better, powered by science.

## Introduction
PreferenceRank is a versatile and scientific tool for ranking anything you like, inspired by viral character/bias sorters but enhanced with a more rigorous approach. Rank your favorite characters, foods, movies, or travel destinations with precision and fun.

## How It Works
PreferenceRank employs a **round-robin tournament system** where items are compared against each other. By default, every item is compared with every other item for a full ranking. A **Quick Rank** option is also available, which uses an **active learning algorithm** to intelligently select the most informative pairs to compare. This provides a more accurate ranking with fewer comparisons than a random subset. Items are scored using the **Bradley-Terry Elo rating system**, providing transparent and relative preference scores.

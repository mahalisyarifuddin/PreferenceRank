# PreferenceRank
Sorting made better, powered by science.

## Introduction
PreferenceRank is a versatile and scientific tool for ranking anything you like, inspired by viral character/bias sorters but enhanced with a more rigorous approach. Rank your favorite characters, foods, movies, or travel destinations with precision and fun.

## How It Works
PreferenceRank employs a **round-robin tournament system** where every item is compared with every other item, ensuring fairness. Items are scored using the **Bradley-Terry Elo rating system**, providing transparent and relative preference scores.

## Quick Start
1. Download the `PreferenceRank.html` file from the repository.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser.
3. Start ranking your preferences!

## Key Features
- **Flexible Input**: Rank anything—characters, foods, movies, destinations, and more.
- **Fair Algorithm**: Every item is compared with all others using a round-robin system.
- **Scientific Scoring**: Utilizes the Bradley-Terry Elo rating system for accurate results.
- **Lightweight**: A single HTML file with no external dependencies, making it portable and fast.

## Customization
PreferenceRank is open source, allowing you to modify and adapt it as needed. Tweak the algorithm, redesign the UI, or add new functionality—it's all up to you.

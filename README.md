# PreferenceRank
Sorting made better, powered by science.

## Introduction
PreferenceRank is a flexible and scientific tool for ranking anything you like, inspired by viral character/bias sorters but enhanced with a more rigorous approach. Whether it's your favorite characters, foods, movies, or travel destinations, this tool ensures precise and fun rankings.

## How It Works
PreferenceRank uses a **round-robin tournament system** where every item is compared with every other item. This ensures fairness in the ranking process. Items are scored using the **Bradley-Terry Elo rating system**, which provides transparent and relative preference scores.

## Quick Start
1. Download the `PreferenceRank.html` file from the repository.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser.
3. Start ranking your preferences!

That's it—no installation or dependencies required.

## Key Features
- **Flexible Input**: Rank anything—characters, foods, movies, destinations, and more.
- **Fair Algorithm**: Every item is compared with all others using a round-robin system.
- **Scientific Scoring**: Leverages the Bradley-Terry Elo rating system for accurate and transparent results.
- **Lightweight**: A single HTML file with no external dependencies, making it portable and fast.

## Customization
PreferenceRank is open source, so you're free to modify and adapt it as needed. Whether you want to tweak the algorithm, redesign the UI, or add new functionality, it's all up to you.
